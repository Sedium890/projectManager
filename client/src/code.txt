Notes:

Backend works so no need to fiddle with projectManager/server file.

Need to figure out what it is that's wrong with the api endpoints. Maybe that's what's wrong? 


I have looked at the possibility of there being an error which I found that my import statement in productRoutes.js for my productController.js was incorrect. (FIXED)

but I am still getting a 404 error... investigating...
